        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <span class="muted">hi, i‚Äôm william ü§†</span>
      </div>

      <p>howdy ü§† i‚Äôm william, a 2nd year software engineering student and occasional assignment victim. i‚Äôm an intp so i spend a lot of time lost in thought, jumping between random ideas, and getting way too deep into stuff most people wouldn‚Äôt care about.</p>

      <p>i like a lot of different things. coding and ai keep me curious, math keeps me challenged, and video games keep me sane. i‚Äôm also into anime and shows that have dark themes and characters who aren‚Äôt simply good or bad. outside of screens i hit the gym, trying to fix the skinny fat struggle, and i‚Äôve been getting more into fashion so i can actually look put together.</p>

      <p>i tutor too, mostly math, which is fun when my students actually get it and a bit humbling when they clown me. i think it makes me better at explaining and also forces me to keep learning.</p>

      <p>this website is basically my little space to show who i am, what i enjoy, and what i‚Äôve been working on. if you stick around you‚Äôll probably end up knowing more about me than some of the people i see every day.</p>
