      <p>howdy ü§† i‚Äôm william. i‚Äôm in my second year of software engineering and i‚Äôm still figuring it out. i‚Äôd say i‚Äôm an intp.</p>
      <p>i like a lot of different things. coding and ai keep me curious, math keeps me challenged, and video games keep me sane. i‚Äôm into anime and shows too. if you‚Äôre into that, there‚Äôs a whole section for it.</p>
      <p>i tutor as well, mostly high school math. it‚Äôs fun when it clicks, and humbling when it doesn‚Äôt. it makes me better at explaining and keeps me learning.</p>
      <p>this site is just my little corner to show who i am, what i enjoy, and what i‚Äôm working on. if you hang around, you‚Äôll probably know more about me than some people i see every day.</p>
      <p>just to add to the dream theme, here‚Äôs one i remember clearly:</p>
      <p>i got this wrist device that worked like a grappling hook. i‚Äôd shoot it at walls and poles and swing around like spider-man. it felt insane. i was flying through the city and laughing.</p>
      <p>i passed my old high school. most of it looked like a construction site. there was this ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù building with no doors, no stairs, just bricks and one window up top. with the device i could finally reach it, so i swung up and slipped inside.</p>
      <p>the room had secret stuff pinned on the walls. i took a photo, tried to bail, and got caught. the punishment was to repeat my final year if my parents approved. that freaked me out.</p>
      <p>i went home. people started acting off. outfits changed in seconds. memory felt broken. the vibe shifted from fun to horror. someone i should feel safe with turned into a threat. i ran with a sibling, called a friend, tried to get help. the call kept putting us on hold.</p>
      <p>it ended there. the feeling stuck. freedom, curiosity, consequences. i woke up still waiting on the line.</p>
